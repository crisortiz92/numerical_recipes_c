# \<Numerical Recipes in C> Codes with Examples

This repository contains codes from the book \<Numerical Recipes in C> with my comments. The codes are contained in a function, which is called in the
main function with example inputs. All codes can be compiled and run without input parameter.

## Usage

For MacOS, the codes can be compiled by `clang util.c file_to_compile.c -o programme`. The compiled code can be then run by `./programme`.

## Content

The codes included in this repository, in correspondence to the book's chapters:

**Chapter 2 Solution of Linear Algebraic Equations**

- Gauss-Jordan Elimination with full pivoting: `gauss_jordan_full_pivot.c`
